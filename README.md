# OpenGL-point-selection

[中文版](README_zh.md)

**Basic OpenGL project, implementing Phong model, first person controller, and point selection. Based on this, an extension of volume detection can be made (implemented using AABB bounding box concept), but it requires keeping the model still, which is not interesting enough, so this item is not displayed.**
